Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Stanford medical professor and likely next NIH director, 
delivered a [sermon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GljbhvGQ9EE) at the height of the pandemic that draws surprising parallels between biblical leprosy and our cultural response to COVID-19. 

In his address at First Presbyterian Church Mountain View, Bhattacharya shares 
his experiences treating leprosy patients in rural India and explores how 
stigma shapes our perception of disease. The sermon examines biblical 
accounts of leprosyâ€”contrasting Elisha's distant healing of Naaman with 
Jesus's revolutionary choice to physically touch lepers.

"From the beginning of the pandemic, society divided people into 'essential' 
and 'non-essential,'" Bhattacharya observes. "When someone gets COVID, what's 
the first question we ask? 'Where did you get it?' We treat contracting the 
virus like a moral failing." 

This sermon from February 2022 offers insights that remain relevant today as 
Bhattacharya faces Senate confirmation as the next NIH director. His perspective 
on stigma and disease provides a unique framework for understanding how faith 
might inform our public health approaches.

Keathley and Swamidass [review Loren Haarsma's book](/articles/when-sin-begin-review) 
which proposes four scenarios reconciling evolution with the doctrine of original sin. 
While Haarsma presents these as equally viable, the reviewers identify significant 
problems with both his scientific arguments and theological conclusions.

Scientifically, the review identifies substantial errors in Haarsma's population 
genetics discussion. These errors lead to the unfair exclusion of several important 
ancient Adam and Eve scenarios that are compatible with evolutionary science.

Theologically, the reviewers conclude that scenarios affirming a historical Adam 
face far fewer challenges than those treating Adam as symbolic. The latter require 
major reinterpretations of Scripture and potentially undermine the doctrine of 
creation's original goodness.

The review affirms that many ways to reconcile evolution with original sin exist, 
but concludes that Haarsma's book fails to accurately represent both the scientific 
evidence and the theological implications of various harmonization attempts.

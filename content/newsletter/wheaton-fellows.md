We are excited to announce the Wheaton Fellows Program—a prestigious fellowship designed to equip Christian scholars in secular institutions with a robust theological foundation and lasting connections within the Christian academic community. More details about the program can be found here: [Wheaton Fellows Program](https://www.wheaton.edu/graduate-school/wheaton-fellows-program/). 

The program is targeted on Christians with permanent academic positions at secular universities. It features fully funded week-long theological training institutes at Wheaton College, offering an immersive “theological boot camp” experience that provides expert guidance, networking opportunities with esteemed scholars and thought leaders, and comprehensive support covering travel, lodging, and participation costs along with a generous honorarium. This transformative opportunity is designed to empower scholars to integrate their faith with their academic work. 

We are reaching out to you because we value your connection to key individuals in your ministry and networks, and we kindly ask for your assistance with the following:

Please invite any qualified applicants within your network to consider applying for this fellowship.
Consider sharing this opportunity on your mailing list so that potential candidates can learn about this time-sensitive program.
Please note that applications are due by March 30, 2025. For further details, please see our [website](https://www.wheaton.edu/graduate-school/wheaton-fellows-program/).

Thank you very much for the work you do, and for considering partnering with us in this way.
